# Formula 1 Data Transformation and Optimization

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to transform raw Formula 1 data stored in CSV files into a highly structured SQL database. The project focuses on ensuring data integrity by applying appropriate constraints and optimizing database performance through the use of indexes and partitions.

## Key Features
- **Data Transformation**: Convert CSV data into a structured SQL format.
- **Constraints**: Apply necessary constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints) to ensure data integrity.
- **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune database performance using indexes and partitions.
- **Oracle Database as a Service**: The project uses Oracle Database as a service, leveraging the official Oracle image repository.

## Prerequisites
- Oracle Database (running as a service using the official Oracle image repository)
- Node.js
- OracleDB Node.js driver

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
